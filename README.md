## Overview

Rock climbing is a diverse sport with many distinct disciplines.  In the sport and traditional climbing styles, climbers ascend in pairs.  One climber is the belayer, holding the rope while the other climber (the leader) climbs.

The leader is tied into the other end of the rope, and he or she clips the rope through protection lodged in the rock along the way up.  
Climbers use a mix of fixed, drilled bolts, and clean protection (nuts, cams, and hexes) brought up from the base to protect a climb.

If a climber falls while leading, the length of the fall will equal twice the distance to the last piece of protection, plus the stretch distance of the dynamic rope.

Depending on a complex system of variables (e.g. fall distance, climber mass, fall factor, rope elasticity), such a fall can put large amounts of force on a climber's protection.

FallSafe is a tool for modeling the force of a climbing fall and testing that force against the published strength ratings for climbing protection.
